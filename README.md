Learning the basics of Redux

## Getting Started

To be able to run this code go to the specific folder the code is in via `cd` command in terminal or command prompt.

Afterwards run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Also run `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit` to install the Redux JS toolkit package, afterwards

go into your `package.json` file then to the redux library and delete the entry from the file, because redux is already included in the toolkit package

(Be sure you're using node version 16 when running the code `nvm install 16`.)
